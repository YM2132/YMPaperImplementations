    "This post will be a lot shorter than my last, on the <a href=\"https://ym2132.github.io/Progressive_GAN\">Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN)</a>, as the StyleGAN reuses a lot of the techniques from the PGGAN. As such, I strongly suggest you read the PGGAN post if you haven't before proceeding.\n",

    "The implementation of the StyleGAN has some major differences to the Generator architecture, the underlying structure follows the PGGAN paper, but the Discriminator model remains unchanged from the PGGAN. Through modifying the G setup, StyleGAN achieves better image generation than PGGAN. Also this paper covers some very interesting topics which shed light on the inner workings of GANs. Before we implement the model we can explore these topics together.\n"
